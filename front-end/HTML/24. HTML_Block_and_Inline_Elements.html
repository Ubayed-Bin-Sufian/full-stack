        .myDiv {
          border: 5px outset red;
          background-color: lightblue;    
          text-align: center;

        <h2>Block-level Elements</h2>

        <p style="border: 2px solid orange">Hello World</p>
        <div style="border: 2px solid green">Hello World</div>

        <p>The P and the DIV elements are both block elements, and they will always start on a new line and take up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).</p>

        <h2>Inline Elements</h2>

        <p>This is an inline span <span style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</span> element inside a paragraph.</p>

        <p>The SPAN element is an inline element, and will not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.</p>

        <h3>The div Element</h3>

        <div style="background-color:black;color:white;padding:20px;">
            <h2>London</h2>
            <p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
            <p>Standing on the River Thames, London has been a major settlement for two millennia, its history going back to its founding by the Romans, who named it Londinium.</p>
        </div> 

        <h3>The span element</h3>

        <p>My mother has <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">blue</span> eyes and my father has <span style="color:darkolivegreen;font-weight:bold;">dark green</span> eyes.</p>

        <h1>The div element</h1>

        <div class="myDiv">
            <h2>This is a heading in a div element</h2>
            <p>This is some text in a div element.</p>
        </div>

        <p>This is some text outside the div element.</p>
